      <para>Welcome to the CruiseControl.NET Common Communications Client. This is a light-weight
.NET library that can be used to communicate with a CruiseControl.NET server.</para>
	<para>This library is still in the process of being developed and may change
significantly over the next few iterations.</para>

    	<title>What is the Common Communications Client?</title>
    	<content>
    		<para>The Common Communications Client is an attempt to consolidate the
way that clients communicate with the CruiseControl.NET server.</para>
			<para>There are different ways to communicate with the server - the most
common are .NET remoting and HTTP. Unfortunately in versions of CruiseControl.NET prior
to 1.5.0, each client needed to implement its own implementation of these protocols,
and each client had its own quirks. Additionally, there was no implementation that could
be used by third-party components and applications - they needed to build their own
implementation!</para>
			<para>In contrast, the Common Communications Client is designed to be a simple
and easy way for any client to communicate with a server, over multiple different protocols.
As well as this simple goal, the client is also designed to be extensible - so if you don't
like the way we've done things, it is easy enough to swap in your own components.</para>
